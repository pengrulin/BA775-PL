## Challenges & Future Directions
- **Data Limitations:**  
  - Inconsistencies with the `unitid` prevented merging with external university rankings.
  - The dataset, being a decade old, may not fully reflect current trends.
  - Numerous missing values, particularly in SAT scores, awards, and graduation rates, highlight the need for more comprehensive data.
  
- **Future Work:**  
  Plans include integrating more up-to-date datasets and establishing clearer links between university rankings and performance metrics to refine insights further.
